# Scenengine
> Engine for interactive media & games

## Description
> Scenengine is an engine / motor written in C++, it can be used for creating
> interactive media or games.

> At its core, it does just consist of a set of classes to help build
> interactive media and such content.
> The first purpose Scenengine was to serve; was being a boilerplate for
> creating games.

## Compiling & Executing / Running

        # Compile
        make

        # Execute / Run
        ./game.out

## Technical description
### Graphics
> Scenengine uses OpenGL to talk to the graphics card, a long with SDL2.

### Input
> Scenengine uses SDL2 for controller interactions. (Keyboards, mouse, etc...)

## Now
> Right now, the code is suppost to be used as a boilerplate rather than an
> application or library.

> Clone it down, use it for your media / game and modify it how you wish.

## Future
> In the future, Scenengine will have a graphical interface inspired by the one
> Game Maker uses.
> Scenengine will turn into an application rather than a boilerplate.
> This graphical user interface will be used to with less effort create media/game
> objects & structure.
> It shall be very lightweight and mostly server the purpose of autogenerating
> classes, setting properties of objects etc.

> Unlike Game Maker, the user interface will not contain a text-editor, and
> it will not contain an image/sprite-editor.
